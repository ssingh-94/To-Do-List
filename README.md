# To-Do-List

A simple To Do list that allows you the option to add, delete, or cross off things you've planned for the day. 
Hover over list items and click the text to cross it off your list, or delete things with the trash can icon.
Add things to your list by typing text into the "Add New Todo" bar, hide this option by clicking the large plus icon in the corner.
